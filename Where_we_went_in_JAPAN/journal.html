<h2 style="text-align:left;">Day 1-5 <br /></h2>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The moment we arrived at<span> Japan you could feel the people and the cleanness that they are really strict</span> and hope we could still keep the environment as if it was helped and not destroyed. The we went to the taxi place and had two cars. Our bags are so full that we needed two other kind gentlemen to help our bags on the taxi. we were all marvleing at the sight of Japan and didn't bother to see what time it is and what do we need to do afterward. It seems like only a minute was past and we were at our hotel<br /></div>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Day 6-10<br /></h2>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Then, after breakfast one of us will drive on the highway to our first stop: Nigata. We first go to a small amusement park, and spend half day there relaxing; then go to a small cafe with air conditioner and connect our wifi and stay their for lunch. Then we will find a capsule hotel to sleep in over night. Then next morning I drove to Nagano, and we found this other really really famous cafe with free wifi!!!!we stay there I forgot how many hours and Melanie found a really cool small wood cabin hotel with 3 rooms in the cabin, and we stay there for the night. We went back to the awesome cafe and leave around 11:30; then Joyce drove all of us to Kyoto, and guess what we did? DUH! If you ever go to Kyoto, the first thing you should do is SHOPPING!!!! We bought lots of cool souvenirs and cool items for our friends back in homeland.<span></span><br /></div>

<h2 style="text-align:left;">Day 10-14<br /></h2>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">We ended our fabulous vacation by visiting the last four destinations: Hiroshima, Osaka, Nagoya, and Tokyo. Hiroshima was so cool, we went to the place where the nuclear bomb landed; it was a super fun trip. We then visited the museums, some were historical while others were artistic. The food was very yummy there, and we had a wonderful time. Osaka was a real adventure, we stayed at the Universal Studios for a whole day. Seeing the amazing sets were very entertaining, and we went around and played on almost everything. The Universal Studios Japan is a must-go if you ever visit Osaka. The next day was relaxing, we were still wiped out from yesterday's amusement park. But it wasn't a waste. We ate the tasty steak; the restaurant was very nice and satisfying. Nagoya was, in a word, awesome. We watched theme movies for about two hours, and despite the language, we loved watching them. And we finished the movies, we found some small, but fun places to spend the rest of the day at. We enjoyed our time at Nagoya, and we took tons of pictures. Finally, we ended the trip, sadly. We drove to Tokyo, packed ourselves up, went to Mount Fuji, and returned our car. We were sad about leaving for a while, but then realized when we get home, we can tell everyone about our trip, and we went everywhere we planned to go anyways. We loved Japan, and never regretted our decision, for it was the best time EVER!!<br /><span></span><br /></div></div>
